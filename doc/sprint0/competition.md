# Competition
## Quora
[Quora](https://www.quora.com/about) is primarily a questions and answers forum in which users can have their questions of any topic answered by numerous individuals of varying specializations. Among these topics are various topics revolving around startups and entrepreneurship in general.

### Differentiating Factors
1. Our product is purely focused on Startups whereas Quora has a broad range of unrelated topics.
2. Their product is solely based upon Q & A forums and does not allow for other types of interactions

### User Impact
1. Our product has a more narrow scope, ensuring that the information found by the users will be catered to their business in some way, instead of having to sort through irrelevant media.
2. Our product allows the users to have access to several services besides advice forums in which they may use to benefit their business

## Startup Nation
[SN](https://startupnation.com/about-us/) is a repository of information for developing startups. They have several different resources from webinars, contacts, articles and more, with their primary source being articles. SN works towards growing entrepreneurs by providing them the knowledge and guidance they need.

### Differentiating Factors
1. Our product provides a recruiting system in which individuals can join startups
2. Our product provides team management allowing for formation of groups

### User impact
1. Users are unable to easily find or approach growing startups they wish to join on SN
2. SN does not host an area in which teams can be formed or companies can be advertised. There is little to no interactions between growing startups.

## Reddit
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) is a social news and discussion website also known as “The front page of the internet”. It is home to tens of thousands of communities which also include very specific niche communities catered to startups, entrepreneurs and business people alike.

### Differentiating Factors
1. Our product is focused on startups, whereas the news and information on reddit is on a wide variety of topics.
2. Reddit is limited to a forum. Most of the other features are focused on casual browsing and anonymity. 

### User impact
1. Reddit has a general news section which has news that is mostly unrelated to the forum and is curated based on the “upvotes” on each of the posts. These posts may or may not be of interest to you. Hence users won't have a personalized experience for their business on this platform.
2. Apart from the forum, Reddit does not have many other features that a startup marketplace has, like recruiting, funding options, employee lookup, etc. Hence the experience for young entrepreneurs is incomplete on this platform.

## Y Combinator
[YC](https://www.ycombinator.com/) is a platform used by startup founders to obtain seed funding. They also help startups by paying for all expenditures when they are getting started. The platform helps bring venture investors to companies that need a small amount of money in exchange for a small stake in the company.

### Differentiating Factors
1. The platform offers an application process for small amounts of seed funding for startups. Whereas our product also lets users log in and access a whole marketplace with more integrated features like - search, funding, banking, company integration, etc
2. A forum is present but it is very limited and is focused on Q&A. 

### User impact
1. Unlike Y Combinator, the funding will not be provided by us, but our platform lets users search for eligible funding opportunities and filter through different options like banks.
2. Our forums are more interactive where users can contribute to answering queries. Instead of a Q&A style forum it is a conversation between multiple parties.

## Upwork
[Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/about/) is an online platform in which they connect employers to potential employees. On Upwork, employers can post jobs or seek out specific skills/projects posted by individuals looking for work. On the other hand, individuals seeking work can apply to job postings and post skills for employers to find them by. Upwork also provides resources for those unfamiliar with the platform or hiring in general on both the hirer and job seeker sides.

### Differentiating Factors
1. Upwork’s sole purpose is for job seeking and does not provide additional features to users
2. Upwork has many services available for companies for a fee.

### User Impact
1. Our product provides more features apart from a focus on hiring, such as team management
2. All services available on Upwork are provided by freelancers, whereas the services provided by our product are not necessarily at a cost and have a focus on startup needs, removing the need to sift through irrelevant services.

## Ownr
[Ownr](https://www.ownr.co/company/about) provides support for individuals starting a business. For a variable fee, users can create a modular breadth of tools to aid them in creating their business (e.g. incorporation documentation and legal services). Ownr also provides support through its “Ongoing Company Management”, such as annual accounting filing and online help desk.

### Differentiating Factors
1. Ownr’s product works on a subscription basis with some of its features being restrictive on number of users (without incurring additional costs)
2. Ownr’s focus is set on assisting growing companies through mostly documentation

### User Impact
1. Our product is not restricted behind a paywall to see features. This allows for startups to see what is available to them without having to invest first.
2. Ownr’s resources are not targeted towards helping startups develop in terms of employees or guidance on how to develop their products. Whereas our product provides resources on hiring and development services.
