# Process
## Team Organization
All the work for the project is divided equally between all the members of the team, if anybody feels otherwise they can voice their concern and based on how the majority of the members feel we could change how the work is distributed.
* Daniela Venturo is the scrum master for all our sprints.
* All other roles will be rotated amongst team members - eg. The meeting minutes will be recorded by a different member each week, in alphabetical order by last name. Along with other roles as specified in the contract.

## Tools
* __Discord__: All decisions are made through polls. The polls are hosted on a “polls” channel on discord, where all members must vote. Additionally discord is also used to meet using the voice channels.
* __When2meet__: To organize a time for the whole team to meet. This helps us visualize when we have time available in the week when all members are free to meet.
* __Google Docs__: To record meeting minutes. As per the team contract we will circulate whose turn it is to record them. We will be going alphabetically by last name starting the week of May 24th. The minutes as well as other documents will be stored on the team google drive folder before we finalize and submit.
* __Git__: All work once a draft is ready will be submitted through git on the github repo for team Epsilon.
* __Jira__: Will be used to plan and coordinate work and for all other project management that is required during the duration of this project.  
* __Figma__: Will be used to create prototypes of the user interface.
## Meetings
All members must attend a weekly meeting where we touch base on the progress of the project and discuss sprint material. Additional meetings can be held if required by smaller teams sharing tasks for individual parts of the project or additional problems that need a quick fix. Weekly stand-ups will occur in the course Discord server's voice channel, while smaller meetings will occur in the team server's voice channel. 
## Priority of Tasks
In order to decide the priority of each of the user stories/tasks, we will use SCRUM poker. To avoid cognitive bias, each member will make a decision about the task then reveal how long they think it will take along with all the other members. Furthermore we will discuss these results until we come to a consensus. On average we would require 3-4 rounds to decide.
## Lessons Learned
* As a team we need a better understanding of the scope of the project. Many of us have a different idea of what the final product will look like. In order to work around this we will hold more meetings to discuss what we imagine the end result of the project will look like so we can be on the same page.
* We should start working on the material for each sprint as soon as the next cycle starts, as we need more time than previously anticipated.
